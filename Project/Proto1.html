    <h1>A) Vehicle Type , Lighting affecting vehicle accidents</h1>
    <div id='PLOT1'></div>

    <p>From the provided parallel coordinates graph, which compares the count of accidents across different light conditions
        and vehicle types, several trends can be inferred:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Light Conditions Impact on Accident Frequency:</strong><br>
        Daytime sees the highest number of accidents for passenger cars, which is expected as there are typically more cars
        on the road during this time. However, the difference between daytime and dark (with lights on) is not as pronounced
        for sports utility vehicles, vans, and pickup trucks, suggesting that these types of vehicles may be involved in
        accidents more evenly throughout different light conditions. The least number of accidents occur at dawn and dusk
        across all vehicle types, which could be due to fewer vehicles on the road during these times.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Vehicle Type and Accident Correlation:</strong><br>
        Passenger cars are consistently involved in more accidents than any other vehicle type across all light conditions,
        likely due to their prevalence on the roads. Sports utility vehicles have a high count in accidents during the
        daytime but a significantly lower count during dark (lights on), indicating that they might be safer to drive or
        less commonly driven at night. Pickup trucks and vans show a similar pattern to each other, with counts decreasing
        less dramatically from daytime to dark (lights on) compared to passenger cars and sports utility vehicles.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Public Transport Vehicles:</strong><br>
        Transit buses and school buses have a lower incidence of accidents across all light conditions when compared to
        personal vehicles. This could be due to the professional training of bus drivers, the larger size of the vehicle
        which may deter risky behavior from other drivers, or the fact that they are on the road for fewer hours per day
        compared to personal vehicles. Interestingly, the accident count for school buses is much higher during daytime 
        than at night. This is probably due to the fact that most school timings are during the daytime.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Emergency Vehicles:</strong><br>
        Police vehicles have a relatively lower count of accidents but seem to be involved in more accidents during the
        night (with lights on), which could correlate with high-speed pursuits or emergency responses during these times.
    </p>
    
    <p>The graph illustrates the relationship between light conditions and accident counts while considering the type of
        vehicle involved. To make comprehensive inferences, it would be essential to consider external factors such as
        traffic volume, weather conditions, and geographic location. Additionally, the actual number of vehicles on the road
        for each category during the different light conditions would be needed to understand the accident rates properly.
        Without this contextual information, the inferences drawn are speculative and based solely on the visual data
        representation provided.</p>


    <h1>B) Vehicle Type , Movement affecting vehicle accidents</h1>    
    <div id='PLOT2'></div>

    <p><strong>Constant Speed:</strong><br>
        Passenger cars have the highest number of accidents while moving at a constant speed, likely due to their prevalence
        on the roads. Sports utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and vans also have significant accidents at constant speed but
        less so than passenger cars, reflecting their smaller numbers on the roads.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Slowing/Stopping:</strong><br>
        There is a decrease in the number of accidents for all vehicle types during slowing or stopping movements. Transit
        buses show a relatively high number of accidents while slowing or stopping, possibly due to their frequent stops and
        the associated risk of rear-end collisions.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Stopped in Traffic:</strong><br>
        Passenger cars and sports utility vehicles show a noticeable number of accidents when stopped in traffic,
        highlighting their vulnerability to collisions in congested conditions.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Left Turn:</strong><br>
        A significant number of accidents occur during left turns for all vehicle types, as this maneuver often involves
        crossing oncoming traffic, leading to potential side-impact collisions.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Accelerating:</strong><br>
        Fewer accidents occur during acceleration for all vehicles, possibly due to the shorter duration of this movement
        and more attentive driving.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Right Turn:</strong><br>
        Right turns seem to be safer, with fewer accidents reported for all vehicle types, likely because they generally
        involve fewer conflicts with other traffic in right-hand drive jurisdictions.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Parked and Parking:</strong><br>
        Minimal accidents are reported for vehicles that are parked or parking, as expected due to these being static or
        low-speed maneuvers with a reduced chance of collision.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Special Cases - Public and Emergency Vehicles:</strong><br>
        Transit and school buses display a distinct pattern with a lower overall number of accidents but higher incidences
        in certain maneuvers like slowing/stopping and right turns, reflecting their unique operational patterns. Police
        vehicles maintain a consistent but low count of accidents across all movements, possibly due to advanced driver
        training and the use of warning equipment.</p>
    
    <p>It is crucial to consider that the raw count of accidents does not factor in the total number of vehicles or the
        distance traveled. Additionally, without information on the severity of accidents or external factors such as
        weather conditions, traffic signals, or road designs, these observations are based on the assumption that the data
        is representative of the overall population of vehicles and their movements prior to accidents.</p>

    <h1>C) Vehicle Type , Weather affecting vehicle accidents</h1>
    <div id='PLOT3'></div>

    <p><strong>Weather Conditions:</strong><br>
        The highest number of accidents across all vehicle types occurs in clear weather, possibly due to increased traffic
        and less cautious driving. Cloudy conditions result in a lower but still significant number of accidents. In foggy
        and rainy conditions, accidents decrease further, suggesting increased driver caution or reduced traffic. Snowy
        conditions see the lowest accident counts, likely due to drastically reduced traffic and more cautious driving
        behavior.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Vehicle Types:</strong><br>
        Passenger cars show the highest accident counts in all weather conditions, reflecting their higher numbers on the
        roads. Sports utility and pickup trucks experience fewer accidents as weather conditions worsen, perhaps due to
        better handling. Vans, transit buses, and school buses have lower overall accidents, potentially due to professional
        driving and limited operation hours. Police vehicles maintain a consistently low accident count, likely due to
        professional driving and vehicle readiness for diverse conditions.</p>
    
    <p><strong>General Observations:</strong><br>
        There is a trend of decreasing accidents with worsening weather from cloudy to snowy conditions for all vehicle
        types, which may be influenced by a reduction in traffic volume and heightened driving caution.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Justification:</strong><br>
        The analysis assumes that the data accurately reflects the number of accidents without considering the total number
        of vehicles on the road, which could impact the interpretation of accident rates. Thus, while poor weather might be
        expected to increase accidents, actual counts may be lower due to fewer drivers and more cautious behavior.</p>
